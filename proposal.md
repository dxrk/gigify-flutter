## App Description

Gigify is an app designed to enhance the concert experience for its users. It provides personal event recommendations and helps guide social planning by fostering a social environment, allowing users to connect with friends, express interest or satisfaction in an event through a ‘like’ feature, and coordinate attendance plans within friends through in-app messaging. Additionally, users receive notifications regarding upcoming concerts and events from their favorite artists, as well as events that their social networks are planning or are interested in.

## Minimal Goals

- Spotify and Ticketmaster/BandsInTown API interaction
- Recommend concerts that match based on bands/genres
- Gives Concert recommendations based on bands/genres
- Use location data to pull nearby concert recommendations

## Stretch Goals

- Connect with other people with similar music and concert tastes, and assign a “compatibility score”.
- Social media type feed with images from concerts
  - Images also may be posted under an artists page or venue page so other consumers can see what a past event was like.
- Personalizable Sprite for profiles
  - User is given specialized clothing/art for going to concerts
- Featured concerts
  - Concerts recommended to all users
